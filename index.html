		<h2>Hurricane Maria </h2>
		<article>
			<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOn August 22nd 2018, Hurrican Maria wreaked havoc on the island of Puerto Rico. Winds up to 155 miles per hour tore apart 300 mile island. While other countries were also badly hurt from the damage of the storm, Puerto Rico embraced the full power of the storm. It was one of the worst storms to hit the island in over 50 years.</p>
			
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspToday, the island has a rough estimate of 60% power. This number rapidly flucuates due to the electrical grid being drastically delicate. Puerto Rico has not been able to get back on its feet since that Summer day and has been heavily dependent on donations to survive. Over 300 deaths have been recorded since the hurricane due to the effects of the storm. Hospitals didn't have the necessary resources to treat patience and electricity was inconsistent. The Carribbean island needs 90% of its resources imported from other countries, even the motherland United States. Mass amount of donations ranging from food, water, clothes, batteries, and other resources were charitably donated territory in a time of need. Any donation can help so if you would like to donate, click the menu button in the top left corner. This will bring you to multiple GoFundMe pages that are in need of resources like food and water. Anything is appreciated.</p></br>
			
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMoney is tight for a lot of people who would like to help out, but don't have the resources to do so. If you would like to find a place to volunteer time or drop off food or supplies, click <a href="https://prvoad.communityos.org/cms/irma">HERE</a>. </br> If you are looking for what type of resources are being asked to donate, click <a href="http://prfaa.pr.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Presentation-United-for-Puerto-Rico.pdf">HERE</a>. This will give you a list of things that people still need today on the island. </br>A big reason of helping out is keeping the conversation going. Don't forget to share stories you see online about the island or talk about it to people. Sometimes tragedies get put on the backburner after a few weeks of people helping out and it's on the next one. Click HERE to share a story or post about Puerto Rico.</p>
